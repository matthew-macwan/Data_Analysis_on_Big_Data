# Working_with_Big_Data

### Project Summary

In this project, I want to take some time to understand the differences when working with datasets that are much larger than the ones many courses and college classes utilize. I chose two large datasets (27 Million Rows) and (1.8 Million Rows) to perform some data analysis and computations on. Two packages were compared, Dask and datatable as these datasets are too large for pandas and I wanted to gain some experience using them. For a more in-depth explanation of the project, please view the Jupyter notebook.
